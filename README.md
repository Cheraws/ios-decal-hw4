Wednesday, November 16 at 11:59 PM

## Description
Last week, we covered some basics of multimedia in iOS. We will be using our
knowledge of the AVPlayer and AVPlayerItem to stream songs from SoundCloud.

Our goal in this assignment will be to create an app that plays tracks from a
SoundCloud playlist. Additionally, this will serve as an exercise in reading and
understanding programmatic design.

## Instructions
**Create a SoundCloud Player App**
* Required
  * PlayerViewController.swift - the player and view for the song
    * Tapping a the Play/Pause button should play or pause the song
      * It should also toggle the button image accordingly
    * Next button should load and play the next song
    * Previous button should either rewind or load and play the previous song
* Optional
  * Create your own (or use your existing) playlist instead!
    * The only thing variable to change would be the playlistID parameter
  * Add a Scrubber which can seek to a specific track time
